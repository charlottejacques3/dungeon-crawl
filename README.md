# Dungeon Crawl

## Description

Technologies used: Processing (Java)

As a school project, I created a video game where the player navigates a maze of rooms and tunnels to reach the end of the level. Along the way, they encounter various types of monsters that they must fight off, with a final boss in the very last room.

To implement this project, I utilized object-oriented programming concepts within Java's Processing library.
